          A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown,
          Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a
          camera. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough
          reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're
          little gifts.

          But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Don't fiddle with it all day. Let's make a nice
          big leafy tree. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Now we'll take
          the almighty fan brush.
